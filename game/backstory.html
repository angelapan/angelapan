		<h3>backstory</h3>
		<p>You are Roy Melvin, a 53-year-old writer. Your wife is Beatrice Melvin. Your daughter, Irene Melvin, died two years ago. She was 20. You went through a stage of depression five years ago due to your mom's sudden death, and you developed an alcohol addiction. She was 17. You neglected your family and threw away your life savings for alcohol. Once Irene tried to calm you down during one of your fits, and you gave her a black eye.</p>
		<p>You never bothered to ask Irene about her life, and you weren't aware of the stress she was under. Beatrice was thrown into a state of despair. Irene thought there was no other way.</p>
		<p>One afternoon you decided to take a nap. You woke up to Beatrice crying.</p>
		<p>"Irene's dead! Irene's dead!" Beatrice mumbled out between sobs. Irene had ran in front of a moving bus. She was killed instantly.</p>
		<p>You were still slightly drunk, you had no idea what was happening. It took a while for the words to sink. What did you feel? Nothing. You couldnt't help but feel nothing. You knew you should have felt something. Was it the alcohol? It shook you to the core, not your daughter's death, but your lack of a reaction. It was your fault, wasn't it? It's time to sober up, you thought.</p>
		<p>Now it's two years after the incident. You still hear your wife cry in her sleep sometimes. When you write about the incident in your book, sometimes you have to take a break and drink some tea and take some deep breaths. Once you even dreamt that Irene's ghost haunted you. Hopefully it was a dream. Will you ever get closure? You're not sure.</p>
